Abstraction is a process of hiding implementation details and showing functionality only
Abstract classes:
abstract class are classes that are declared with abstract keyword they help us achieve
abstraction.
abstraction helps us divide the workload in multiple child classes and it helps us reduce the
complexity of code
Rules:
1) use abstract keyword to define an abstract class.
2) we can have an abstract class with or without abstract methods
3) we must declare a class as an abstract class even if we have a
single abstract method inside it.
4) we can not create the object of an abstract class directly, but we can extend this class
and can create the objects of child classes that way we will be able to use fields and
methods from abstract class.
5) we can not declare a class as final and abstract because final means no extension and
abstract means incomplete and some classes should extend it and complete it.
6) we can have public private protected members in abstract class.
But in an interface always all the fields are public static final.
7) we can not have a method as static and abstract at the same time
8) we can not have a method as private and abstract because private members
don't participate in inheritance and we will never be able to provide boyd of that method.
9) we can not have a method as final and abstract.

Interface in java
Interfaces in java are also used to achieve abstraction
Rules:
1) All the fields in an interface are by default public static and final
2) All the methods in an interface are public and abstract by default
