"Super" keyword:
Super keyword is only applicable when we have at least two classes that have
prent child relationship if we have a duplicate field/method in parent and child class
we can use super keyword to refer to the parent class field/method and if we do not
use super keywor field/method from child class will be referred.
we can also use super keyword with parentheses to call the  parent class constructor so that
we do not repeat that code in all the child classes.
