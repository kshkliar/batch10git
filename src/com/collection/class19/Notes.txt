Constructors:
    Is a special block of code that helps us build/initialize(give initial values to fields)
    our objects.
    when we write new className(); the code inside the no argument
    constructor is executed.
    when we do not provide a constructor a default no argument constructor
    is provided by compiler.
    if we have multiple constructors java will check the number of arguments and type of
    arguments to decide which constructor to execute.
    if we have same number of parameters and their datatype are also same
    we will get an error as now Java can not decide which constructor to call
This()
this keyword when used with parenthesis calls the constructor of a class which constructor to call
is decided based on the data type of arguments that we are passing.
It helps us reduce duplicate code as n real life projects we might be writing a lot of constructors
