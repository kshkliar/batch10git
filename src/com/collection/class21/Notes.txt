"this" keyword:
We can use this keyword to differentiate between local and instance variables.
class Car{
String make;
String model;
int year;
Car(String make,String model, int year){
String make="Honda";
this.make=make;
this.model=model;
this.year=year;
}

void (){
int year=2021;
String make="Honda";
String model="Civic";
System.out.println(this.make+this.model+this.year)

}

}
"this()"
we can use this() to refer to the constructors of the class
if we have multiple constructors java will decide based on the parameters
which constructor to call.
this keyword to call the methods
==================================================
Inheritance:
is mechanism in java through which we can access all the fields and methods from one
class inside another class
We use extends keyword to inherit the properties and methods
Advantages:
we can avoid code duplication
it improves the performance
it reduces the amount of memory required to run the program.
Disadvantages:
Parent child classes are tightly coupled if we make any changes we must change the child
classes as well otherwise code may beak.
Types of inheritance
1) Single inheritance
one single parent class and one single child class.
2) Multilevel inheritance
we have chain of classes inheriting from each other for example
class C=> class B=> class A
3) Hierarchical inheritance:
one parent class and multiple child classes
