Method overloading in java:
Method overloading is when we have same name of a method inside a class
but with different type, number or sequence of parameters.
We overload method to reuse code and write cleaner code.

class Overload{

void hello(){
}
void hello(String name){
//overloading by changing number of parameters
}
void hello(String [] names){
//overloading with different type of parameters
}
]
void hello(String [] names,String name){
//overloading by changing number of parameters
}
void hello(String name,String [] names){
//overloading by changing sequence
}

}
Method overloading rules Rules:
    1) To overload we must have at least two methods with same name inside a class
    2) we can not overload a method by just changing the return type
    3) we can not overload by just changing the access modifier
    4) static methods can also be overloaded
    5) We can also overload the constructor of a class
Var args
is a mechanism in java through which we can handle arrays and multi arguments of same type
in a method parameter.
we can treat the var agrs same as an array inside the method

void (String ... names){
sout names[0];
sout names.length
for (int i=0; i<names.length;i++){
sout names[i];
}
}
}
interview question:
Can we overload main method:
Yes, you can overload main method in Java.
 But the program doesn't execute the overloaded main method when you run your
 program, you have to call the overloaded main method from the actual main method
