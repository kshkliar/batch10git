Loops in JAVA:
	while
	do while
	for
	for each loop/advanced for loop/enhanced for loop

while and do while loop repeat block of code as long as the condition is true!

while first checks the condition and only then executes block of code
do while executes block of code and only then check the condition

Do loop executes code at least ONCE even when condition is FALSE

While and do while loops are used WHEN WE DO NOT KNOW IN ADVANCE HOW MANY
TIMES WE WANT TO REPEAT BLOCK OF CODE.

------------------------------------------------------------------
for loop - used when we know in advance how many times we want to repeat same block of code
