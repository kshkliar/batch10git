Methods:
Methods are collection/block of code inside a class that represents the behaviour
 of that class.
There are two types of methods:
1) Built-in methods like next() and nextLine();
2) User defined methods
Those methods which do not return anything are called void methods

int getMax(int number1,int number2){

if(number1>number2){
return number1;
}else{
return number2;
}
}

int=>return type
getMax=> method name
(int number1,int number2)=> method parameters
{                      => Body of the method
if(number1>number2){
return number1;
}else{
return number2;
}
}
