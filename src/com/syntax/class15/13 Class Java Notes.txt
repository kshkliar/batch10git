class:
class is a blueprint/template/ design, objects are units that created from the class
Class is logical entity whereas Object is physical entity

Create a Class "Phone". Create 3 Objects of it: iPhone, Android, Nokia with specific
attributes and behaviors.

Create a Dog Class and create 3 different objects of it: Husky, Bulldog, Labrador
with specific  attributes and behaviors.
Method/behavior/function is a block of code that performs certain operation.
when we call a method all the code inside that method is executed.

class Student{


void study(){
System.out.println("Studies ");
System.out.println("Studies ");
System.out.println("Studies ");
}
}

class StudentTester{

public static void main(String[] args){
System.out.println("Line before method call ");
Student student=new Student();
student.study();
System.out.println("Line after method call  ");
}
}
