=========================================
String
Are immutable that means once we store a string in a variable we can not change its value if we are changing the value a new
object in String constant pool is created and
reference is reassigned to that variable.
StringBuilder is mutable which means we can change the value of a variable and no new memory cells are created.
When to use Strings.
when we have a lot of repetition in the data and we care about the memory consumption we should use the String class
when to Use the StringBuilder:
when there are a lot of changes to the data and we care more about the speed of the program we should use StringBuilder class
Difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer is that String builder is Not thread Safe hence more fast and StringBuffer
is Thread safe but slow.
