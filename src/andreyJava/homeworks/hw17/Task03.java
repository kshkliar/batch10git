/*The file contains characters, whole numbers and floating point numbers.
        Write a class that has the following functionality: in a loop, a user enters the data type (one of them: char, int, double, String),
        in response, the application prints out to the console all the values of the corresponding types that exist in the file.
       In other cases "Incorrect input" should be printed.
        Resolve the task using regular expressions.

        Note: A 'String' should be considered a sequence of two and more characters.
        Characters - Latin or Cyrillic letters letters in upper or lower case (make sure to envisage that Cyrillic letters may be in the input file).

        Example of the original file:
